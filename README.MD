## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs two numbers.
2. If the first number is smaller than the second:
   - It loops through the numbers in between.
   - Each number is passed to a function to check if it’s **prime**.
   - All valid primes are displayed on screen.
3. If the first number is larger or equal to the second:
   - An error message is shown.
